This is a large-scale eddy image dataset from ocean current data of the publication "A-Streampath-Based-RCNN-Approach-to-Ocean-Eddy-Detection"

# Paper main messages:
In this paper, we present a new eddy detection approach via deep neural networks to improve eddy detection accuracy. First, we present a streampath-based approach to build a large-scale eddy image dataset from ocean current data and apply our dataset to eddy detection. Second, by combining the multilayer features in the neural network with the characteristics of the eddies, we achieve a competitive detection result with an mAP of 90.64% and an average SDR of 98.91%, which performs better than the previous methods. Third, through our enhanced eddy visualization approach, we solve the problem that eddies are difcult to detect in the sparse streampath region.
